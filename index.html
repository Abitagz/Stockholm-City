               <h5>Stockholm City</h5>
               <p>Stockholm is famed for its iconic city hall, the world's first open-air museum and the fabulous Abba museum. 
                But there are plenty of little-known facts about this city that even some locals might not be aware of â€“ including 
                an unusual story about Frank Zappa.</p>

                <h5>Stockholm City</h5>
                <p>Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, encompasses 14 islands and more than 50 bridges on an extensive Baltic Sea
                 archipelago. The cobblestone streets and ochre-colored buildings of Gamla Stan (the old town) are home to the 
                 13th-century Storkyrkan Cathedral, the Kungliga Slottet Royal Palace and the Nobel Museum, which focuses on 
                 the Nobel Prize. Ferries and sightseeing boats shuttle passengers between the islands.</p>

                <h5>Semlor</h5>
                <p>Semlor is plural for semla. The Swedish-Finnish semla consists of a cardamom-spiced wheat bun which has its top cut off, 
                 and is then filled with a mix of milk and almond paste, topped with whipped cream. The cut-off top 
                 serves as a lid and is dusted with powdered sugar. Today it is often eaten on its own, with coffee 
                 or tea. Some prefer to eat it in a bowl of hot milk.</p>
